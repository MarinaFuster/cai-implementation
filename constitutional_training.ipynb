    "**Constitutional AI (CAI)** is a concept introduced by Anthropic in their paper. It is a method aimed at aligning AI systems with human values and ethical principles, particularly harmlessnes. CAI involves training AI models to follow a set of predefined rules or \"constitution\" that guides their behavior. This approach is particularly useful for practical settings where ensuring the AI's alignment with human values is crucial."

The goal is to align the model's behavior with the preferences and values of the users by using feedback directly from them. This process involves collecting user feedback on the model's outputs and using this information to adjust the model's parameters, ensuring that it produces results that are more in line with what users want and expect.
